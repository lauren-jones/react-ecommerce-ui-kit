## UI Components for Skincare Store

A UI component library designed for a skincare/beauty e-commerce store, built with React, Typescript, Rollup and Storybook.

## Project Status

The component library is published as an npm package here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ecommerce-ui-kit

I have used the npm package to build this frontend e-commerce web app project: https://sunny-croquembouche-e680ef.netlify.app/

## Live preview

A live preview of the components (in Storybook) is hosted here on netlify: https://capable-stroopwafel-e97bb1.netlify.app/

## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.

Installation:

`npm install`

To Start Storybook:

`npm run storybook`

## Reflection

This was a side project, built in conjunction with an e-commerce web app UI. Project goals included using Storybook and Typescript for the first time, and using the components to build the frontend of an e-commerce store.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, Typescript, Storybook and Rollup. This project did not use the 'create-react-app' boilerplate, since it is a library as opposed to an app.

The component library is publically available as a published npm package.
